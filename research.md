        <p class="abstractp"> The Counterfactual Average Structural Function (CASF) is the Average Structural
            Function (ASF) averaged with respect to a counterfactual distribution of covariates.
            In the binary choice model, the CASF measures the rate of successes in a counterfactual
            scenario. This paper shows that the CASF is non-parametrically identified
            as a weighted average, where the weights are given by a likelihood ratio. Estimation
            of the CASF at the regular root n-rate requires a square integrability condition for
            those weights. This necessary condition depends on instrument strength, the degree
            of endogeneity, and the relevance of the regressors. Much insight is gained from the
            single normal regressor model. In this setting, I show that extrapolation strength
            (the capacity of the model to regularly identify the CASF) increases with the relevance 
            of the regressor and, surprisingly, with the degree of endogeneity. The impact
            of instrument strength is found to be non-monotone. Moreover, I find a threshold for
            instrument strength below which regular identification of the CASF is not possible. </p>

        <p class="abstractp"> Many economic and causal parameters of interest depend on generated regressors, including
            structural parameters in models with endogenous variables estimated by control
            functions and models with sample selection. Inference with generated regressors is complicated
            by the complex expression for influence functions and asymptotic variances. We propose
            automatic debiased GMM estimators in a general setting with generated regressors. 
            Importantly, we allow for the generated regressors to be generated from machine learners,
            such as Random Forest, Neural Nets, Boosting, and many others. We use our
            results to construct debiased Doubly Robust (DR) estimators for the Counterfactural Average
            Structural Function (CASF), and LR estimators for structural parameters and partial
            effects in models with sample selection and endogeneity. </p>

        <p class="abstractp"> This paper generalizes Escanciano (2021)’s identification result and
        Van Der Vaart (1991)’s information result to models parametrized by a
        Banach space. It provides a general framework to study identification
        and its regularity (regular if the Fisher information is positive, irregular
        if it is zero) for a wider range of problems. In particular, this paper
        argues that non-parametric estimation of (a) the mean of a known
        transformation and (b) the density at a point naturally give raise to a
        Banach tangent space. Using the extended framework, the paper shows
        that Fisher Information for estimation of the mean of a transformation
        is zero if the transformation is not square-integrable. Information for
        estimation of the density at a point is zero if one considers an absolutely
        continuous (Lebesgue) density.   </p>
