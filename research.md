        <p> The Counterfactual Average Structural Function (CASF) is the Average Structural
            Function (ASF) averaged with respect to a counterfactual distribution of covariates.
            In the binary choice model, the CASF measures the rate of successes in a counterfactual
            scenario. This paper shows that the CASF is non-parametrically identified
            as a weighted average, where the weights are given by a likelihood ratio. Estimation
            of the CASF at the regular root n-rate requires a square integrability condition for
            those weights. This necessary condition depends on instrument strength, the degree
            of endogeneity, and the relevance of the regressors. Much insight is gained from the
            single normal regressor model. In this setting, I show that extrapolation strength
            (the capacity of the model to regularly identify the CASF) increases with the relevance 
            of the regressor and, surprisingly, with the degree of endogeneity. The impact
            of instrument strength is found to be non-monotone. Moreover, I find a threshold for
            instrument strength below which regular identication of the CASF is not possible. </p>
